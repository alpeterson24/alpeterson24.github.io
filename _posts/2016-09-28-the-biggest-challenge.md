title: My Biggest Scariest Challenge I've Faced While Learning to Develop
---

Ok, maybe it's not that scary, but was it a challenge? To answer that question we must look at what the biggest challenge is. The biggest challenge for anyone getting started is just that, getting that momentum started. The world of web development is so huge it can be easy for someone starting out to get overwhelmed. Like any skill, development can be learned, nobody is born writing code just like nobody is born solving complicated math problems. With the proper fundamentals and many, many hours spent absorbing material one can be where they want to be.

My biggest scariest challenge was actually just trusting myself, trusting that I had what it takes to survive and thrive in this industry after spending many good years in an entirely different arena, and just getting started! Like I described before there are many things to learn and there are always new frameworks, even new languages and a few new concepts.

What we need to remember is that no matter how big and scary challenge everything can be achieved the same way, one step at a time. I've seen many new developers try to learn three or four different programming languages at the same time not realizing that learning one language and hammering down the fundamentals will lead to the best results. Then, if learning other languages and concepts are necessary they will be easier to grasp.

In conclusion, I recommend that anyone walking the path of becoming a new developer takes their time to learn the fundamentals, build that foundation. For example, writing functions and manipulating arrays and loops before moving on to new frameworks and technologies. It will make your life easier and if their is one thing you should take away from this blog, remember, one step at a time. Learning web development will take time, it will get frustrating, and maybe you will want to quit. Don't quit because you will be missing out on one of the greatest and most rewarding  opportunities you could imagine.
