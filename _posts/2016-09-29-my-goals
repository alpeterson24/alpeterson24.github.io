title: My Goals as a Frontend Developer

###My Goals

As a frontend developer my goals are simple. I want to have a firm grasp on the fundamental concepts. There is no doubt that in my future career I will have to use these concepts. A fullstack developer needs to be well-rounded and have some level of expertise in frontend, as well as, backend technologies. 

I think I will be much better in the backend capacity. Frontend development sounds to me like a lot of design and user experience work. I know I am not very artistic, just don't have a good eye for it. The key to being good at anything is laser-focus but it never hurts to have a some experience in other disciplines. Maybe this is something that I can improve through Bloc.
