title: My Experience at Bloc.io

Have you ever had a job that drained you? Perhaps I should be more specific. Have you ever had a job that drained you physically, metally and emotionally? A job where you go to work everyday just to make a paycheck. A job where you are chasing money and numbers.

This is not a bash on the traditional model of thinking, rather a reformation in attitude. We work hard and get to where we want to be, or so we think. That was my story, working nights and weekends, getting promoted and making a good salary but in the end being drained. It seemed to me that I knew what I wanted but what I was missing was passion. Something that makes the long hours worth while.

Building something from the ground up has always peaked my interest. My dad is a construction contractor and I watched countless buildings being built and what I saw in that man was passion.  Something that was instilled in me from a young age. His job wasn't glamorous, he destroyed his knees and his overall health, but in the end he built something. When we drove by one of his buildings he would say "look, I built that". I don't believe coding is too much different than this experience. The opportunity to build and maintain something you are passionate about is not something everybody accomplishes but everyone should know that feeling, not the feeling of building a house, but the feeling of passion.

Bloc has been an excellent oppurtunity for me to build something from the ground up. I really believe I have found my passion. It is not easy but it has been worthwhile. What really sold me on Bloc was the mentorship and support. I never go long without someone there to offer guidance.
