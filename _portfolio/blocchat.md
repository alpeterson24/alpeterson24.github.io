### Summary
Blocchat is a messaging and chatroom application that I created AngularJS and the Firebase API for the back-end. I developed this as a part of Bloc's curriculum and with a little help from my mentor.

### Explanation
The project was started with some starter code and some guides on using Grunt. The design and much of the implementation created by me. I utilized some of the great features that Angular has to offer such as Angular Cookies, UI Router, Firebase and AngularFire.

### Results
This is one of the projects I am proudest of, not only because it was challenging but it was also my first attempt at back-end technologies and using an API. These concepts can be very challenging for a beginner. Although I don't see myself as a designer I really like the way I designed this project. This was my second project using Angular and the experience and struggles of creating it were instrumental in my personal coding development.
