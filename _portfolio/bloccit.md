short-description: Reddit Replica created with Ruby on Rails and tested with Rspec.
---
### Summary
Bloccit was my first application created with Ruby on Rails. It is a replica of the popular website Reddit and I created it with my mentor at Bloc. It was also my first attempt at deploying to production on Heroku. This was also my introduction to RSpec testing.

### Explanation
This project was provided by Bloc as a starter project and was done with a little help from my mentor. Bloc helped us go through this project in a series of checkpoint to teach us the proper work flow for completing the project in a Test Driven Development style.

### Results
Bloccit was a great first project to learn Ruby on Rails. I think it was relatively successful for a first try. Any time you take on something this new there will be challenges. As I went through the project things started clicking and I really started to feel I could create something more independently.

### Conclusion
I am proud of my first Ruby on Rails project, although, there are some newer projects that are a little more impressive. This project was a big step toward building my confidence as a developer.
