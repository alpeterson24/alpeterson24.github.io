### Summary
This project was inspired by some Youtube tutorials I had watched in game development in HTML5. I decided I wanted to give making a game of my own a shot. It was more challenging than I had imagined and took many hours to get the paddles and the ball synced properly.

### Explanation
The Challenges I came across in this project were almost entirely working with new methods I had never worked with before. Additionally, working with x and y coordinates and lining up the ball to the correct place and assuring it bounces off of the correct places.

### Result
Overall, I am pleased with the way this project turned out. It took me longer to code than I had initially thought. It would have been much smoother with more planning. The plan, now, is to make the computer harder to beat. I discovered that a particular playing style will beat the computer every time no matter the speed increases.
