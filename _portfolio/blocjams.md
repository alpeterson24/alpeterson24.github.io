short-description: BlocJams project that I created!
---

### Summary
BlocJams is a web-based music player that allows you to, you guessed it, listen to music. This project was developed to enhance my frontend development skills using HTML, CSS, Javascript and some jQuery. It was a really fun project that was challenging and rewarding.

### Explanation
Though much of the development was guided, many of the functions were left to us to solve, thus giving us the gratification of completing the project and ensuring it was operational.

### Result
The project was an overall success. BlocJams does what it was meant to do, Play music! It's not perfect but it was a learning experience that I can build on.

### Conclusion
This, being my first project, went really well. It was the first coding project I started and completed and that is an accomplishment. It only makes me want to learn and build better applications so I can eventually solve bigger problems.
