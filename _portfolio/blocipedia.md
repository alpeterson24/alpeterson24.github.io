short-description: A wiki website created with Ruby on Rails and the Stripe API.
---

### Summary
Blocipedia is a wiki style website that I created at Bloc. This was my first independent project that was made with just a few simple wireframes for direction. Most of the design and implementation was left up to me. I developed this strictly to better my understanding of Ruby on Rails and try out some new things along the way.

### Explanation
This project is part of Bloc's curriculum and was meant for us to really focus on our skills of back-end development.

### Result
Blocipedia, again, was my first independent try at Ruby on Rails. Going back and looking at the project it was very challenging working with gems for the first time and their API's as well. This made me better at reading documentation and googling (Yes, googling). After sorting out mistakes, with the help of my mentor, the project turned out really well.
